Per questo la questione decisiva è capire come Dio ci chiama, perché altrimenti noi parliamo di Dio in astratto, lo buttiamo fuori dalla realtà, lo releghiamo dove noi pensiamo che sia, e in questo modo guardiamo la realtà, come dice il Papa, restando nell’apparenza, non riconosciamo di essere chiamati a rispondere a Lui attraverso le circostanze. Ma don Giussani ci ha educato a riconoscerle e a guardarle per quello che sono: la modalità con cui Dio ci chiama, che può essere qualcosa di assolutamente banale (un piccolo bagliore) o una circostanza cupa, a volte non trasparente,

A notable experiment in 2007 showed that cognitive flexibility improves after just one thirty-five-minute treadmill session at either 60 percent or 70 percent of maximum heart rate. The forty adults in the study (age fifty to sixty-four) were asked to rattle off alternative uses for common objects, like a newspaper — it’s meant for reading, but it can be used to wrap fish, line a birdcage, pack dishes, and so forth. Half of them watched a movie and the other half exercised, and they were tested before the session, immediately after, and again twenty minutes later. The movie watchers showed no change, but the runners improved their processing speed and cognitive flexibility after just one workout. Cognitive flexibility is an important executive function that reflects our ability to shift thinking and to produce a steady flow of creative thoughts and answers as opposed to a regurgitation of the usual responses. The trait correlates with high-performance levels in intellectually demanding jobs. So if you have an important afternoon brainstorming session scheduled, going for a short, intense run during lunchtime is a smart idea. A lot of the research I’ve mentioned in this chapter revolves around exercise’s effect on the hippocampus, because its role in forming memories makes it vital to learning. But the hippocampus isn’t off by itself somewhere, stamping out new circuits on its own accord. The learning process calls on a lot of areas, under the direction of the prefrontal cortex. The brain has to be aware of the incoming stimulus, hold it in working memory, give it emotional weight, associate it with past experience, and relate all this back to the hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex analyzes the information, sequences it, and
